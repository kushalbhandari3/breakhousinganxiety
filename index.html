            <h2>ðŸŒŸ A Project Close to My Heart ðŸŒŸ</h2>
            <p>As the Student Trustee at Springfield College, I am launching a project that tackles a deeply personal issue: the overwhelming stress, loneliness, and uncertainty faced by students who cannot go home during academic breaks due to financial, logistical, or safety concerns.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Break Housing Anxiety is the stress, uncertainty, and isolation experienced by students who cannot return home during academic breaks due to financial, logistical, or safety concerns. For many, the high cost of travel, visa restrictions, unsafe home environments, or lack of affordable on-campus housing create significant challenges. Instead of a time to rest and recharge, breaks become a source of anxiety, leaving students struggling to secure basic needs like housing, food, and community support.</p>

            <h2>Here is the Plan</h2>
            <p><strong>Giving Day (March 6, 2025):</strong> On the 10th anniversary of Giving Day, we invite students, faculty, staff, alumni, and supporters to contribute to the Student Emergency Fundâ€”an initiative started by students to support their peersâ€” which provides vital assistance to students experiencing unexpected financial hardships. These funds are designed to assist the students so that they have the support they need to continue their education, including financial hardships during academic breaks.</p>
            <p><strong>Cultural Gala (April 11, 2025):</strong> A vibrant celebration of diversity, talent, and togethernessâ€”featuring dazzling performances, heartfelt songs, mesmerizing dances, and a unique fashion show. More than just an event, this gala will serve as a fundraiser for the same cause--providing vital assistance to students experiencing unexpected financial hardships. </p>
