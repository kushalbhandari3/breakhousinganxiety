        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Break Housing Anxiety is the stress, uncertainty, and isolation experienced by students who cannot return home during academic breaks due to financial, logistical, or safety concerns. For many, the high cost of travel, visa restrictions, unsafe home environments, or lack of affordable on-campus housing create significant challenges. Instead of a time to rest and recharge, breaks become a source of anxiety, leaving students struggling to secure basic needs like housing, food, and community support.
